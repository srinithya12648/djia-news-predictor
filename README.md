# DJIA Movement Prediction Using News Headlines

This project uses deep learning models to predict the movement of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) based on daily news headlines.

## Dataset
The dataset contains daily news headlines (25 per day) with labels indicating whether the DJIA index closed higher (1) or lower (0).

## Project Highlights
- Data preprocessing with CountVectorizer and TF-IDF
- Deep Neural Network model
- LSTM-based sequential model
- Early stopping and model checkpointing
- Performance evaluation with accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report

## Future Improvements
- Incorporate pre-trained embeddings like GloVe or FastText
- Use Transformer-based models (e.g., BERT)
- Experiment with more financial datasets
